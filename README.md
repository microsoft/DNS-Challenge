# Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) Challenge 4 - ICASSP 2022

## In this repository

This repository contains the datasets and scripts required for ICASSP 2022 DNS Challenge, AKA DNS
Challenge 4, or DNS4. For more details about the challenge, please see our
[website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/deep-noise-suppression-challenge-icassp-2022/).
For more details on the testing framework, please visit [P.835](https://github.com/microsoft/P.808).

## Details

* The **datasets_fullband** folder is a placeholder for the datasets. That is, our data downloader
  script by default will place the downloaded audio data there. After the download, it will contain
  clean speech, noise, and room impulse responses required for creating the training data for
  wideband scenario. The script will also download here the test set that participants can use
  during the development stages.
* The **NSNet2-baseline** directory contains the inference scripts and the ONNX model for the
  baseline Speech Enhancement method for wideband. 
* **download-dns-challenge-4.sh** - this is the script to download the data. By default, the data
  will be placed into the `./datasets_fullband/` folder. _Please take a look at the script and
  **uncomment** the perferred download method._ Unmodified, the script performs a dry run and
  retrieves only the HTTP headers for each archive.
* **noisyspeech_synthesizer_singleprocess.py** - is used to synthesize noisy-clean speech pairs for
  training purposes.
* **noisyspeech_synthesizer.cfg** - is the configuration file used to synthesize the data. Users are
  required to accurately specify different parameters and provide the right paths to the datasets
  required to synthesize noisy speech.
* **audiolib.py** - contains modules required to synthesize datasets.
* **utils.py** - contains some utility functions required to synthesize the data.
* **unit_tests_synthesizer.py** - contains the unit tests to ensure sanity of the data.
* **requirements.txt** - contains all the libraries required for synthesizing the data.

## Datasets

The default directory structure and the sizes of the datasets available for DNS Challenge are:

```
datasets_fullband 892G
+-- dev_testset 1.7G
+-- impulse_responses 5.9G
+-- noise_fullband 58G
\-- clean_fullband 827G
    +-- emotional_speech 2.4G
    +-- french_speech 62G
    +-- german_speech 319G
    +-- italian_speech 42G
    +-- read_speech 299G
    +-- russian_speech 12G
    +-- spanish_speech 65G
    +-- vctk_wav48_silence_trimmed 27G
    \-- VocalSet_48kHz_mono 974M
```

In all, you will need about 1TB to store the _unpacked_ data. Archived, the same data takes about
550GB total.

## Code prerequisites
- Python 3.6 and above
- Python libraries: soundfile, librosa

**NOTE:** git LFS is *no longer required* for DNS Challenge. Please use the
`download-dns-challenge-4.sh` script in this repo to download the data.

## Usage:

1. Install Python libraries
```bash
pip3 install soundfile librosa
```
2. Clone the repository. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/DNS-Challenge
```

3. Edit **noisyspeech_synthesizer.cfg** to specify the required parameters described in the file and
   include the paths to clean speech, noise and impulse response related csv files. Also, specify
   the paths to the destination directories and store the logs.

4. Create dataset 
```bash
python3 noisyspeech_synthesizer_singleprocess.py
```
